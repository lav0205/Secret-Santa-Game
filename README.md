# Secret-Santa-Game
<h3>- Background: </h3><br>
Company "Acme" has decided to organize a Secret Santa event among its employees. Each employee is required to choose another employee as their secret child, to whom they will anonymously give a gift during the event. The company wants to automate the process of assigning secret children to employees based on the provided employee information. However, the Secret Santa system has some additional requirements and constraints.

<h3>- Secret Santa Assignment Rules: </h3> <br>
- No Self-Assignments: An employee cannot be assigned to themselves as their Secret Child.<br>
- No Repeated Assignments: If the employee gave a gift to the same person in the previous year, they cannot assign that person again this year.<br>
- Unique Secret Child Assignment: Each employee should have one unique Secret Child, and no one can be assigned the same Secret Child more than once.<br>
